6/25/2025,,,,Approved for lessons by I Can Swim,,,,,,,,Lauren,"Nolan enjoys being in the water. His mom reports that he has some foundational swim skills such as swimming from side to side in an above ground pool. Nolan prefers to remain in the shallow end of the pool. During the assessment, he was able to walk in the water, front float, blow bubbles and he is beginning to learn how to streamline and glide. Mom mentioned that Nolan used to wear a lifejacket anytime he was in the pool; however, about a year ago he decided he wanted to try to learn how to swim without having to wear his lifejacket. ","Nolan does not like to jump in the pool, he is nervous to go in the deep end and he does not like swimming on his back. During the assessment, he did not enjoy climbing out of the pool. Nolan mentioned that he would like to learn how to coordinate his arm and leg movements while front crawling or doing elementary freestyle.

He enjoys swimming with friends and family. He previously attended a swimming class with Riverbank Recreation department in which he was classified as ""failing"" the class. Mom mentions that he tolerates wearing a life vest. He also enjoys floating on pool noodles while swimming. During the assessment, Ares was observed to walk in water, hold onto equipment, roll over and jump into the pool independently. The instructor placed full face googles on Ares (I.e googles that go over his eyes and nose) and he was able to place his face in the water and swim. His mother mentioned that Ares is most successful when front-loaded with information on expectations or information on what is to come. Ares attempted all skills asked of him. He was able to verbally ask permission to enter the pool when provided with a verbal cue. ","Per mom, Ares does not like unexpectedly getting his face wet. During the assessment, Ares preferred for the full face goggles to remain on if instructed to put his face in the water. He is not yet submerging his face without them on. Ares was also observed to need some support with back floating, submerging and performing front crawl. Ares was also observed to require some support to breath appropriately while swimming. While having a conversation with his mom, Ares would kneel down and look at the water. He did not touch it and his mother said he will typically wait to enter the water until an adult says he can go in but it did create some concern for the assessor.

Adonis is always in a life vest when swimming. Mom mentioned that they put his life vest on at the apartment and will walk down to the pool. They do not leave the house without it. He is very comfortable in the water- almost too comfortable in her opinion which causes fear. Mom mentions that Adonis enjoys going under water and doing front flips. He also enjoys being thrown in the air by his father. Mom reports that Adonis has many emerging swim skills; however, they are all performed in his life vest. He will use a combination of gestures and verbalizations to ask permission to enter the pool. ","On the day of the assessment, Adonis refused to enter the water. He would tell his mother, "" I want to go home"". Adonis was very nervous to get in. The assessment was cut short due to Adonis' refusal to enter the water; however, his mother, Mayra and the instructor held a phone conversation in which mom reports that when submerging, Adonis will stay under water for too long and will accidentally consume water. He has never jumped in on his own; however, he has gotten very close to the water on two occasions. Mayra described herself as not being the strongest swimmer so when Adonis gets too close to water this makes her fear that she won't be able to help or that they would both be in danger especially since she also has another son who is a toddler. She would just like for Adonis to learn how to be safe around water and to gain some survival and independent swim skills. When Adonis returned home after the assessment, he told his mother, ""The pool is too big for me"". Mayra informed the instructor and together decided that during his first lesson that Adonis would begin with his life vest on to see if that will make him feel a little more comfortable.

Tadeo allowed the instructor to hold him and he also tolerated wearing equipment (I.e backpack float). Tadeo's mother mentioned that he can imitate one word statements but his best form of communicating that was observed was gestures. Tadeo hears primarily Spanish throughout his day. The instructor attempted to provide instructions in Spanish and English when possible as well as providing model prompts. To communicate his wants, Tadeo would oftentimes tap the instructor's shoulder and point to a desired item. Tadeo showed signs of enjoyment by smiling while playing with the toys, especially the watering can. When the instructor would provide support around Tadeo's waist he would perform a sculling motion with his hands but moving his hands and arms in and out. His mother says that he will tolerate wearing a backpack but that he has never been in a large body of water before. ","When initially entering the water, Tadeo needed encouragement from his mother and then instructor to enter the water. He was observed to attempt to exit the pool within the first couple of minutes of beginning the assessment. Over time, Tadeo became more comfortable. Once in the water, Tadeo did not attempt to elope again. While swimming, Tadeo was observed to inhale when his mouth would go under water. When this would occur he would cough. The instructor began teaching him close mouth when under then breath. Tadeo was beginning to imitate these motions. While swimming, Tadeo is very stiff. His legs do not move often and when the instructor tried to physically prompt him his legs were very tense. Tadeo also does not like water on his face. His mother reports that Tadeo is curious around water but does not have any safety awareness. She has to be in close proximity to him to ensure that he does not enter water. She mentions that he can be impulsive at times and she wants him to learn water safety skills and how to become a more independent swimmer.

She was able to hold hand of instructor and walk into the pool using the stairs. She was able to hold onto the side of the pool with instructors hand on her back for support. Her feet tend to float up when standing on the steps or she would lose her balance due to the buoyancy of the water. Instructor placed red ankle weights on her which helped stabilize her standing then  she was able to walk on the stairs all the way across with confidence. Once weights were off, she worked on kicks. Sophia is using a bicycle kick. She was able to put her mouth in the water and blow bubbles. She was able to climb out of the pool first with modeling, then with a boost up to the side. She held hands of instructor and jumped in from a seated position.Sophia was comfortable with starfish float if her head is rested on instructors shoulder. Showing her pictures of each activity and explaining it in short phrases helped her understand each activity. When asked, yes or no questions, Sophia said yes every time even though she seemed not excited about the activity or choice after. Instead, instructor switched to choices- this one or this one. She was much happier with what she choose after. Because it is a new activity we should take time and explain vocabulary and activities to Sophia so she understands her choices.

For this assessment, we discussed ways Sebastian will be asking to get in the water. Family shared he is using sign. We decided to start with him using the sign ""swim"" and pairing with a high five before entering the water. If we need to add a more extensive water entry routine. We can. He was able to hold hand with instructor and walk into the water wearing his puddle jumper. He was able to independent float in his jumper. Roll his body and keep his face out. If his head went under, he would shake his head but no aversive reaction. He did not move his feet or kick on his own. He liked to look at toys for a little but but did not kick to them. Then instructor tried weights. Weights increased his foot movement. After that, the puddle jumper was removed. He tolerated all different types of holds. He was ok with his ears in the water in a back float. He will submerge under water but you can tell he is getting water in his nose because he will place his fingers in his nose afterwards.

Parent also shared that when he goes to the lake he will wear a lifejacket ( not his favorite to wear) and sit at the shore. Alejandro was able to walk to the stairs with parent.Once at the stairs, he did not want to get in with instructor. Instructor asked permission to help him get in the water. He then sat on the stairs with instructor for a few minutes to get comfortable. He seemed interested in the toys. Instructor gave him a tight hug/hold on the hip and walked him across the pool in the water to get toys. He pointed to get back to the stairs. We repeated this a few times to build comfort. We were then able to leave the toys out in the water and try to get them. Alejandro started smiling and instructor could feel his body start to relax. He then went into a arms around instructors arms with feet out hold. Instructor asked him if he was ""ready to fly?"" and then put him in a front float position supported with arms. He started smiling. Parent also shared Alejandro does where glasses at school. He tends to look up at the ceiling if his glasses are not on. He also watches his tablet at a hand up view.
